The Art Operation in The 21st Century by A.G. (c) 2014

* BEFORE STARTING:
  * ASK YOURSELF: WHAT KIND OF DATA WILL I BE USING?
  * WHAT IS THE DATA MODEL BENEATH ALL THAT I AM ABOUT TO CREATE, TO EMBARK UPON?
  * WHAT SYSTEMS WILL OPTIMIZE WHAT DATA MODEL?
    * All of the environments, frameworks I have tested thus far do NOT adequately prepare the user for making critical decisions about underlying architecture to support what data types, data structures, what Data Model
    * By the time the programmer has already made it TOO FAR, it is too late to go back and work on the data model.
    * You need a model FIRST, of what kind of data you will be passing around.
    * There is always data. That's rule number one.
    * Rule number two: Data is always of some Type, has some Structure at the physical and logical levels. Find out what that is FIRST AND FOREMOST, before doing anything, even before learning a new language or learning to use a new module or library or framework, environment. Learn that before choosing what Operating System and what device you'll be using.
    * I swear, do it and you will thank me later on. You can't go forward until you've set the limits to how far back you can go. Choosing the data model, designing it - WISELY! - sets a zero-point down. You have no officially launched SOMETHING. Congratulations. You made a critical decision about the underlying data.
    * Everything is BUILT AROUND DATA, ON DATA, THROUGH DATA, BY DATA, etc.

###PHILOSOPHY
* The idea of this Art Operations Repository is to give the individual all knowledge that is required to launch a solo Art Operation, by which we mean an Artistic Practise that is for-profit and sustainable.
* The expertise that has gone into building this precision, rule-based system was gained by hard work over 20+ years of direct, firsthand experience working in the arts.
* It is made possible by virtue of the fact that all of the steps involved have been abstracted and are being expressed in simple rules, what Stephen Wolfram might call "Simple Programs" (See: [A New Kind of Science] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Kind_of_Science#Simple_programs)).
