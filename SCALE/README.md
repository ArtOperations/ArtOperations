SCALE
=====
* One desires to be able to scale up and down as needed.
* One does not desire to "scale up" merely for the sake of it.
* One wants to be able to have a lucrative or fruitful enterprise at lower scales.
* Often one cannot scale, and one should still be able to have a fruitful enterprise.
* One can be frugal, and should be, but growing businesses take inputs, as any enterprise takes many inputs.
* Generally, one wants to minimize inputs and maximize outputs in this regard.
* However, especially in one's articulations/communications, one wants to maximize inputs and minimize outputs.
* That is, often one wants to "crunch down" massive inputs and "crank out" minimized outputs for gentle reading.
* We will speak a great deal about inputs/outputs in the Risks and Inventory sections, as it is something fundamental to the Logistics of Art Operations, big, medium, and small.
