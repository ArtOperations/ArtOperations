DOCUMENTATION
=============
* Documentation is first on the list of todos when even contemplating launching an Art Operation in the 21st Century, alone OR in a group.
* Archival science => This is the meaning of Documentation, a.k.a. Documentation Science. Not mere annotation(s), but Archives/Archival Practise(s).
* One needs "Citability". One needs to manage "addresses" physical and/or otherwise. Retrieval requires it of us, and there are great methods which I will lay out in part.
* When in doubt, WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN (#SOMEWHERE).
* Remember this: You are always trying to "minimize" the actual size of the Archives.
* You are trying to streamline the documentation process so it requires as little effort as possible.
* One wants it to also be exact, to not lose in its effectiveness, efficiency, effect.
* In other words, one is constantly "Compressing" the Archives, "Compressing" one's History.
